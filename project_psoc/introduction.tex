\section{Introduction}

The objective of this project is to design an entire microcontroller system, that uses many common functionalities of a microcontroller. In this lab, we use the PSoC device from Cypress, but the skills that will be learned during this project should be applicable to different microcontroller families (DSPIC, STM32, ...). 

One important part of this project is for students to be able to browse through microcontroller documentation. To reach that objective, information and details about the PSoC microcontroller are purposely left out of this assignment, in order to force the student to find help in online and offline documentation. Teaching assistants can provide support for questions about system design, but will not help with questions that are related to implementation or coding of PSoC functionalities.
